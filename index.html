                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Abishek Khanna, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a flair for creating dynamic and responsive websites. With a strong background in computer science, I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, bringing a holistic approach to building web applications. My journey in web development began with a fascination for how the internet works, which led me to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the years, I have expanded my expertise to include modern frameworks such as React and Angular for creating interactive user interfaces. On the back-end, I am proficient in Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and MySQL, enabling me to develop robust and scalable applications. I am a firm believer in the power of responsive design, ensuring that my projects provide a seamless user experience across all devices. My attention to detail and commitment to clean, efficient code have been the cornerstone of my work. Beyond coding, I am an avid learner, always exploring new technologies and trends in web development. I thrive on challenges and enjoy collaborating with others to turn ideas into reality. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
